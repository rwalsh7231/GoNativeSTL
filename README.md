### Current Bugs
- Limited cells bug?
  Seems as though there is an issue where by scrolling, the number selected per species gets "reset" as the cells are recycled. 
  Selecting 5 oak trees for instance will register in the app, but scrolling down and then back up will make it "appear" that there are 0 oaks selected
  Internally, the app still sees 5 oaks, touching the increment and decrement buttons on the plant will reset it to 0 oaks though.

## Plans
- Fix Bugs
- Whatever else is needed
